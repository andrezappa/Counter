### Introduction to Project
This project consist in the creation of a simple application that work like a counter. The user can increase and decrease by 1 the value of the counter, wich is 0 to default, by using + and - buttons.<br>
In addiction to this basic function I've added some extra buttons and features:<br>
- The user can set a start value for the counter.
- The user can increase or decrease the counter faster while holding down the the two `+` / `-` buttons or increase/decrease by 10 if the counter is a two-digit value.
- A button which automatically increases the value.
- A button to reset the value of the counter.

### Structure
This is the project's structure:
- **index.html** : where I've create the supporting structure of the project, in which the stylesheet (CSS) for the graphics of the counter and the scripts for its functions are inserted.
- **style.css** : stylesheets with which I've create the style and graphics of the counter.
- **main.js** : script with the main js element.
- **functions.js** : script with which I've create the counter functions.

### Technologies used

For create this counter I've used different technologies:
- **Visual Studio Code** as editor for writing code.
- **HTML** for realized the counter's structure.
- **CSS**, for develop the style and graphics of the counter and make the site 100% responsive.
- **JavaScript** programming language that I've use for the realization counter's functionalities.

### Usage

Using the counter is very simple. The counter's value is increased and decreased by 1 with a click on the `+` / `-` buttons. You can also increase or decrease faster while holding down the buttons. If the counter is a twodigit number, and you hold the `+` / `-` buttons 
you can inreases or decreas by 10.<br>
To reset the current value just click on the `reset` button, while if you want the counter to automatically increase its value click on the `auto` button, which you can also stop and restart.<br>
You can also use the keyboard to use the counter :
- `NumpadAdd` to increase the counter's by 1;
- `NumpadSubtract` to decrease the counter's by 1;
- `Delete` to reset the current value;
- `KeyA` to increase automatically the counter's value.
- `Enter` to set a start value.
