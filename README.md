### Introduction to Project
TThis project involves the creation of a simple web application that functions as a counter. Users can increase and decrease the counter's value by 1 using the + and - buttons, with a default starting value of 0. <br>
In addition to this basic functionality, several extra features have been added:<br>
- The user can set a custom start value for the counter.
- Faster increment and decrement by holding down the `+` / `-` buttons.
- Increment and decrement by 10 if the counter's value is a two-digit number.
- An auto button that automatically increases the counter's value.
- A reset button to set the counter back to 0.

### Project Structure
The project's structure consists of the following files:
- **index.html** : This file contains the HTML structure of the project, including the links to the stylesheet (CSS) for styling and the scripts for functionality.
- **style.css** : This stylesheet defines the visual style and graphics of the counter.
- **main.js** : The main JavaScript file for the project.
- **functions.js** : his script contains the counter functions.

### Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create this counter:
- **Visual Studio Code**: Used as the code editor.
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the counter.
- **CSS**: Used to create the counter's style, graphics, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for implementing the counter's functionalities.

### Usage

Using the counter is straightforward. You can increase or decrease the counter's value by 1 by clicking the `+` / `-` buttons. If you hold down these buttons, the counter will increment or decrement faster. If the counter's value is a two-digit number, holding down the buttons will increase or decrease it by 10.<br>
To reset the counter to its default value of 0, simply click the "reset" button. If you want the counter to automatically increase its value, click the "auto" button, which can also be stopped and restarted.<br>
You can also interact with the counter using the keyboard:
- `NumpadAdd` to increase the counter's by 1;
- `NumpadSubtract` to decrease the counter's by 1;
- `Delete` to reset the current value;
- `KeyA` to increase automatically the counter's value.
- `Enter` to set a start value.
